# python_Assignment-2 
This assignment explores fundamental data structures in Python—List, Dictionary, Set, and Tuple—each of which serves unique purposes in programming. By completing these exercises, we aim to understand how these structures work and their applications in handling and organizing data efficiently.

The List exercises focus on creating and modifying ordered collections of elements, allowing us to practice dynamic operations like insertion and iteration. The Dictionary exercises introduce key-value pairs, showcasing how Python manages associated data effectively. The Set exercises emphasize the uniqueness of elements and basic operations like addition and removal. Finally, the Tuple exercises highlight the immutability of this data structure and the use of its fixed-size nature in Python programs.

Through these tasks, we delve into the core principles of Python programming, enhancing problem-solving skills while gaining a practical understanding of data organization and manipulation. This foundational knowledge is essential for tackling more advanced programming challenges.
